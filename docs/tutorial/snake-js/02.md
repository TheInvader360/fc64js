## Creating the snake

What's a snake game without a snake? Let's add a class definition at the top of our script:

```js
class Snake {
  constructor() {
    this.body = [];
    this.direction = {};
  }
  init() {
    this.body = [new Vec2(2, 0), new Vec2(1, 0), new Vec2(0, 0)];
    this.direction = new Vec2(1, 0);
  }
}
```

fc64js provides a ```Vec2``` (two dimensional vector) class - it is comprised of ```x``` and ```y``` instance fields and various methods including ```equals``` that can be used to compare against other instances of ```Vec2```

We make good use of the ```Vec2``` class when modelling our ```Snake``` - it has a ```body``` comprised of an ordered list of ```Vec2``` objects (each one holding its own ```x``` and ```y``` coordinate values), and another ```Vec2``` object defines the current ```direction``` (on both the ```x``` and ```y``` axes)

The ```init``` function offers a means of initialising a ```Snake``` with some default values - three initial ```body``` segments (with the head at (2,0) and the tip of the tail at (0,0)), and a current ```direction``` of (1,0) (i.e. positive on the x-axis and neutral on the y-axis - so moving to the right)
