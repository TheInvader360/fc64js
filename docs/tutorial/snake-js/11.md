## Playing sound effects

We can further improve our rom by adding some simple sound effects

The `beep` function offers a convenient means of triggering sounds - it requires `frequency`, `duration`, and `force` arguments to be provided (the first two being integers and the last being a boolean). The `frequency` parameter is the beep's frequency (measured in hertz), the `duration` parameter is how long the beep should play for (measured in ticks), and `force` determines whether or not the beep should override any currently playing beep or not

A short and relatively high pitched beep suits the positive event of eating a piece of fruit, and a longer relatively low pitched beep suits the negative event of losing

We'll simply add calls to `beep` (with appropriate arguments set) at the relevant points in `romLoop`:

```js
function romLoop() {
      ...
      if (snake.isDead()) {
        beep(280, 15, true);
        changeState(states.gameOver);
      }
      if (snake.body[0].equals(fruit)) {
        beep(1000, 5, true);
        ...
```
