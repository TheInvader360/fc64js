# fc64js - Tutorial - Snake (js)

## Distribution

Now that you have a finished rom you can freely distribute it as you please

You are free to include the [fc64js library](https://github.com/TheInvader360/fc64js/blob/main/lib/fc64.min.js) in your distributions, and it is strongly recommended that you do so (rather than linking directly to github in your html file)

You might like to deploy somewhere online - [github pages](https://theinvader360.github.io/fc64js/rom/game/snake/) and [itch.io](https://theinvader360.itch.io/fc64js-snake) are two good options

Finally, I'm really interested in seeing fc64js roms created by others - please get in touch to let me know about your creations!
