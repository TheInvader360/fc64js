# Minimal Keyboard (fc64js demo rom)

A minimal keyboard test rom for the [fc64js](https://github.com/TheInvader360/fc64js) fantasy console that makes low level memory access API calls only

Fills the screen with specific color pixels if a button is pressed (or black if no button is pressed)

Uses the ```peek``` and ```poke``` API functions, and button, graphics, and color related constants
