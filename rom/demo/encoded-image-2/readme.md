## Overview

A minimal demo illustrating the `imageFromB64String` and `imageFromHexString` util functions

Each image in `docs/rgbcmykw/` was processed by the [fc64js image tool](https://github.com/TheInvader360/fc64js/tree/main/tools/image-tool). The demo uses the resulting image data (raw or hex/base64 encoded) to draw a static scene
