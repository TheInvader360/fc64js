## Overview

A test rom for the [fc64js](https://github.com/TheInvader360/fc64js) fantasy console that demonstrates use of the `swapImageColors` API function

An image containing all the palette colors and some transparent pixels is drawn over a cycling color background and overlaid by a control panel. Swapping colors in the control panel modifies the underlying image accordingly

* Press U/D to switch between "from" colors
* Press L/R to cycle through "to" colors
* Press A/B to reset back to defaults
