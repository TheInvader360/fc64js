## Overview

Dungeon Generator demo for the [fc64js](https://github.com/TheInvader360/fc64js) fantasy console

Procedurally generates fully traversable tile based levels (of a specified size) by carving out a set of directed and random walk paths, then randomly placing a start point, an exit point, and allocating a number of enemy/gold/item locations (each number being a function of the level's size).

* Press U/D to adjust level height
* Press L/R to adjust level width
* Press A to generate a new level
