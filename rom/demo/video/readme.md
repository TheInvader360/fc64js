## Overview

A short looping grayscale video clip rom for the [fc64js](https://github.com/TheInvader360/fc64js) fantasy console

The limited spec of the console (partly the resolution, mostly the tiny palette) means it is not very well suited to video playback - it's probably not worth taking this any further
