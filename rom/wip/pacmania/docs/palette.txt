COL_BLK          - background, ghost, pacman, pill, power pill.
COL_BLU          - block, gate, ghost.
COL_RED          - 
COL_MAG          - 
COL_GRN          - 
COL_CYN          - block.
COL_YEL          - pacman, pill, power pill.
COL_WHT (e6e6e6) - eyes, hud.

Need at least one other colour (e.g. red) for ghosts

The original pacman had:
Blinky: Red
Pinky:  Pink
Inky:   Cyan
Clyde:  Orange

I could have ghosts in each of these colours, or maybe it would be better to save the remaining colours for different colour levels?
