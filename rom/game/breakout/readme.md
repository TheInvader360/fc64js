## Overview

* Use the L/R (or A/B) buttons to control your paddle
* The aim of the game is to keep bouncing the ball off your paddle so that it collides with (and destroys) as many bricks as possible
* You lose a life if the ball goes out of bounds
* The game is over when you lose your last life
* Levels get progressively harder

## Credits

* Code by TheInvader360
